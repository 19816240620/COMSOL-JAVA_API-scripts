# COMSOL-JAVA_API-scripts
Here we provide a COMSOL with its own JAVA API to complete the establishment of geometric models

COMSOL 2D 3D aggregate generation code, directly copy and paste code generation in COMSOL, no additional operations.
Base size parameters and aggregate size, quantity or volume parameters can be customized.
The purchase of complimentary code, with the use of the tutorial, does not require additional coupling with MATLAB, directly in COMSOL can be generated.

(1) Two-dimensional circular tape transition interface itz
(2) three-dimensional ball and belt transition interface itz
(3) Two-dimensional rectangular fiber
(4) three-dimensional cylindrical fiber
(5) Three-dimensional cube fiber
(6) Two-dimensional ellipses
(7) three-dimensional ellipsoid
(8) 2D polygon transition interface
(9) Three-dimensional periodic (aperiodic) directional fiber strip transition interface
(10) Two-dimensional periodic circle with transition interface
